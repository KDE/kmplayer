  manually only.
- More work on SMIL. Allow playing mediatype elements w/o having a region
  assigned, fixes audio only streams (eg. with the <audio> tag).
- Optionally use the expat SAX parser (instead of kmplayer's own one) when
  configured with --enable-expat. Note, the expat parser is more strict and
  therefor can misread some ASX files.
Changes since version 0.9.0-pre3
- Fix for DVD submenus for MPlayer and update regexp for audio/subtitle
  languages
- More work on SMIL. Show active SMIL element in playlist using the color
  settings. Like mediatypes, if set/animate elements have a duration than it

  'excl' is now supported. Text elements are rendered by QTextEdit, so it
  supports html now too. Updated applications in tests/ directory
Changes since version 0.9.0-pre1
- Include tests directory
Changes since version 0.8.4b
- Build fix for compiling with -fvisibility=hidden
- More work on SMIL, support for layout/root-layout/region tags so one can
  position a mediatype in a rectangle, other than video/audio also support
  for text/img mediatypes and flow control with begin/dur/end attribute that
  can be time values but also (mouse) events or clip ends and set/animate can
  be used to alter arguments on-the-fly.
- Added option to adjust the colors of playlist and viewing area
- Added an option in playlist context menu to show all nodes in case of XML
  based playlists (ASX or SMIL)

  possibility in 'Configure Shortcuts' dialog
- Bookmarking a VDR channel now bookmarks it as kmplayer://vdrsource/channel
- When controlpanel is in autohide mode, move it over the video instead of
  shifting the video up causing annoying flickering (bug 96861)
- up/down/ok/back/menu for VDR are added to the toolbar as well when connected
- Unmute DVB card when VDR reports volume of zero, restore on exit
- Auto scroll playlist when current is outside the viewing area
Changes since version 0.8.4-rc4
- Recording now stops movie playing after hitting 'Start Recording'
- Be less strict with parsing ASX (and SMIL) play list files
- Internals: merge code from backends, with the 'never reaching' goal to add
  a new backend just by configuration (plus a backend player of course)
- Internals: move playlist handling to Partbase, instead of each process have
  their own tricks. Also kxineplayer accepts '-vo x11' now, kgstreamer eats
  local url's w/o file:// prefix.
- Internals: re-implement backend XML config and TV config data using own
  DOM-like classes for no less reason than increasing the code coolness :-)
- Added view video/playlist/console to toolbar

  prefix in the name. Rename class KMPlayer itself to PartBase.
- Binary data detection when reading a playlist that turns out to be
  video/audio stream (instead of creating a playlist w/ wierd names)
Changes since version 0.8.4-rc3

- DemiBold font for playlist and console log window for readability
- Begin of GStreamer backend support, local file only

  or use the one the plugin got from konqueror)
- VCD tracks are, for MPlayer only, displayed in playlist and not in menu
- Added custom command for VDR, output to console view
- Made command interaction with VDR much more reliable
Changes since version 0.8.4-rc2

Changes since version 0.8.3-rc4
- Fix regression in show cache progress in 0.8.3-rc2, which made the xine
  backend hang on some web movies

  run kmix standalone or as an applet in kicker.
- Try to limit symbols in the shared objects by using KDE_NO_EXPORT. Although
  hard to measure, hopefully speed up loading the plugin
- New recorder (mplayer -dumpstream) from Stefan Siegel
Changes since version 0.8.3-rc3a
- Downloading of .m3u/.pls also eats .asx, so try to read this one too. This
  fixes also MPlayer-1.0pre not been able to read .asx files.
- Make sure if we're downloading a playlist file, it isn't bigger than 50k
- More or less revert the alsa5/alsa9 change to just alsa. Seems latest
  MPlayer doesn't work with alsa5/alsa9. Although they are still available.
Changes since version 0.8.3-rc3
- add AM_MAINTAINER_MODE in configure.in.in, no recheck/automake/autoconf
  version mismatch
Changes since version 0.8.3-rc2

- Store xine settings in ~/.kde/share/apps/kmplayer/xine_config and not in
  ~/.xine/config2. Save the first time if file does not exist (Automaticly
  sets the misc.memcpy_method).
- Added a debian build directory, builds a kmplayer-lib, kmplayer-plugin and a
  kmplayer-app package. Eg. install only kmplayer-lib and kmplayer-plugin if 
  you prefer another player but do want the plugin for konqueror.
- Added protocol files for mms://, rtsp:// and pnm://
- Position slider now also shows progress of the cache fill

  occur more with the latest Qt versions. KMPlayer uses a XSimpleWindow now
  that is managed by QXEmbed

  multible plugins cooperate with imagewindow/controlpanel
- Combine control buttons and position slider to one control panel
Changes since version 0.8.2-rc5

- MPlayer-1.0-pre is default now ([MPlayer] Post MPlayer 0.90=true in
  kmplayerrc)

  in one stroke with playback (faster playing, less sensible to failures)
- Xine configuration tab for convenient editing of ~/.xine/config2
- Made config dialog somewhat flexible, and TV/broadcast settings are now
  not available when launched from the plugin
- Change dir of mplayer/kxineplayer process if playing a local file. Hopefully

  arts libs (speeds up loading of kmplayer too)
- Moved color sliders to a sub menu, fix it for mplayer

Changes since version 0.7.4c
- Added a simple Xine player backend (kxineplayer). Basically a finger practice
  for the upcoming MPlayer-G2 lib, but now quite useful for rtsp/real playback.

- Added a position slider
- Fixed two cases of double deletes found by valgrind
Changes since version 0.7.2
